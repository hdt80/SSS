1. Please don't break my wiring

2. The only wires that are supposed to be MOVED or UNPLUGGED are the blue, yellow and green wires, which are connected to rows 10, 9, 8 on the BREADBOARD and their other ends would have to be matched with their correct inputs on pins 2,3,4.

3. When you plug in the wire to the correct corresponding pin (2,3,4) wait around a second and the light will light up. if it doesn't, well, it's plugged in to the wrong one.

4. Sometimes lights turn on on their own due to static etc. simply touching the wiring should fix that.
